# Implementation notes

Interpretations, deviations and open questions recorded while implementing the roadmap. Each work package (WP)
has its own heading. Items flagged **NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW** must be resolved by a maintainer before merge.

## WP1 — M0 workspace, CI and gates

Branch `m0-foundation`, stacked on PR #2 (`1-scientific-computing-strategy`). Agent-authored.

### Toolchain and MSRV
- `rust-toolchain.toml` stays at **1.95.0**. ADR-0006 says M0 bumps it to the then-current stable; newer toolchains
  (1.98/1.99) exist on the build machine, but the WP brief fixes 1.95.0 and the pin is on the human-owned meta
  surface (red-team §2 control 1). **NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW:** decide whether to bump the pin in a separate PR.
- `rust-version = "1.85"`: edition 2024 needs 1.85, and every adopted dependency (thiserror 2, serde 1, toml 0.8,
  sha2 0.10) builds on it. Cargo's resolver 3 picks versions compatible with 1.85 (it held trybuild at 1.0.119).
  ADR-0006 is treated as authoritative over STD-005's note (red-team I2): MSRV ≤ toolchain − 2 = 1.93. ✔
- The MSRV CI job skips the `trybuild` compile-fail suite, whose `.stderr` snapshots are rustc-version specific.

### Crate naming
- The WP brief names `ferroastro-core`; ARCHITECTURE.md lists `ferroastro-units` and `ferroastro-real`.
  `ferroastro-core` holds the M0 subset of `ferroastro-units` (quantities, frame/centre markers, time-scale
  markers, `Epoch`) plus the shared `FA-Exxxx` error codes. It can be split when `Real` arrives in M1.
- **Deviation from ADR-0001:** the newtypes are `f64`-only in M0. ADR-0001/API-001 require genericity over `Real`,
  which does not exist until `ferroastro-real` (M1). API-001's "compiles with the DD backend" clause is therefore
  not yet met.
- `Epoch<S>` stores a two-part Julian date (ERFA convention). UTC is omitted on purpose (non-uniform; hifitime).

### Lints
- Workspace lints copied verbatim from docs/standards/rust.md. `clippy.toml` allows unwrap/expect/panic/indexing
  only inside `#[test]` / `#[cfg(test)]` (`allow-*-in-tests`), so library code keeps `unwrap_used = deny`.
- `float_cmp_const` is accepted by clippy 1.95 without an unknown-lint warning (OPEN-ITEMS note on group
  membership: it compiles; whether it is a separate restriction lint was not re-checked).
